#summary What is CyanogenMod\?

= Introduction =

CyanogenMod is a custom ROM based on Android 1.5r3 (crossbred with Donut) focusing on performance, reliability, and safe usage of apps on SD, with some additional features. Yes, this will work just fine on your non-ADP devices. Versions listed as "experimental" may and will have some issues, so unless you want to be a guinea pig, use the "stable" versions.
