#summary Howto: Connect and login to your Android with ssh

=Connect and login to your Android with ssh=

This short article explains how to connect to your android phone
from another computer using the ssh protocol. This allows you to
use a big screen and real keyboard to work on your phone.

The android terminal is a fine app, but I prefer a big screen and
real keyboard any time.

==Prerequisites==

 * Cyanogen rom >= 4.0.2 (for the dropbear binary)

 * Putty (wîndows) or linux with ssh

==Create a ssh key for logging in==

 * create a ssh key with `puttygen` or `ssh-keygen`

 * place the public key into a file named `authorized_keys` on the sd card

==Prepare your Android==

 * Open the terminal and become superuser/root

 * Create the dropbear directory

 * Create the .ssh directory and place the key into it

 * Create a profile in /data/dropbear/.profile with a usable path

{{{
# su
$ mkdir /data/dropbear 
$ chmod 644 /data/dropbear
$ mkdir /data/dropbear/.ssh 
$ chmod 644 /data/dropbear/.ssh 
$ cp /sdcard/authorized_keys /data/dropbear/.ssh
$ echo >>/data/dropbear/.profile "PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/system/sbin:/system/bin:/system/xbin:/system/xbin/bb:/data/local/bin" echo >>/data/dropbear/.profile "export PATH"
}}}

==Connect to your Android==

 * Start wifi and connect to your access point

 * Determine the ip of your phone

 * Prepare/use your ssh client

 # From Linux: 

    * `ssh -i<your-private-keyfile> root@<your-phone-ip>`

 # From Windows (putty) you need to configure putty as follows:

    * Connection - Data - Auto-login Username = root

    * Connection - SSH - Auth - Private key file = <your keyfile>
